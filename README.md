### Installation
````
$ [sudo] npm install bookkeeping -g
````

### Usage

```
  Usage: bookkeeping [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                  output usage information
    -V, --version               output the version number
    -a, --add <desc>...<check>  Add a item
    -r, --remove <id>           Remove a item
    -c, --clear                 Clear all items
    -l, --list <format>         List all items
```

When you add your bookkeeping item, you should follow the convention that your
bookkeeping description and your check are splited by `...`.

```
$ bookkeeping -a 'buy a domain...ï¿¥65'
```

Pay attention that `$` should escape.

```
$ bookkeeping -a 'buy a domain...\$8.99'
```

You can list your check with `-l` flag, it requires a human format like `-3days` or 
`-4days~-2days` to list your check items.

```
$ bookkeeping -l '-3days~-1days'
```

At last, you can also remove your check item with `-r` flag or `-c` flag, you should 
appoint an item id to remove when use `-r` flag. And `-c` flag will remove all of your
bookkeeping items.
